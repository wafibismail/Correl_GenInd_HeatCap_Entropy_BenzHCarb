  <tr><td>02_good_alpha_intervals.m</td><td>Generates 6 correlation curves for each pair of data, also indicating the alpha intervals which results in good correlation</td></tr>
  <tr><td>03_scatter_plots.m</td><td>Generates 6 scatter plots, one for each pair of data</td></tr>
  <tr><td>GoldenSectionSearch_Maximum.m</td><td>Octave implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden-section_search">Golden Section Search</a> algorithm. I manually translated it from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden-section_search">Python code</a> to Octave 7.2. This is required to be placed in the working directory as it is refecenced in two of the other scripts.</td></tr>

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>The above scripts are to be run in Octave. Due to some syntax differences e.g. in subsetting matrices/arrays, they will not run immediately (without ammendments) in Matlab.</p>
